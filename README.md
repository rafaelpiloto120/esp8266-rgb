# Projet Crypto Night Light Led
Very simple project with Neopixel for D1 Mini ESP8266. It is based on the Adafruit Neopixel library.

The goal is basically to set a color and brightness to a WS2812B led.

## Electronics
1x Wemos D1 Mini (or any ESP8266 with 4Mb Flash)
1x WS2812b RGB Led
1x Wires (3 cores, about 3-4cm)
1x Micro USB Cable and 5V Power supply

## Cables assemble
This is one the key steps. Please sure you connect the cables correctly between the Wemos D1 Mini and the WS2812b RGB Led
